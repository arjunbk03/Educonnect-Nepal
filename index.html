        their children's schooling. With two active locations, including a primary school up to grade 8, Maya not only educates but also 
        shelters 80 students, many affected by the 2015 earthquake. Proudly inclusive of all ethnicities, Maya alumni continue their 
        educational journey nationwide, while some even return as educators, perpetuating the cycle of empowerment. The institution 
        currently supports 320 students and employs 33 dedicated staff members across its locations.
